    <h1>History of computer and the internet</h1>
    <p>The history of the computer began with early counting aids, leading to electronic computers like the <i> UNIVAC</i> I in the 1950s, followed by personal computers like the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh in the 1980s. The internet emerged from the 1960s ARPANET, a US military project for data sharing, evolving with the TCP/IP protocol in 1983 to connect different networks.</p>
     

    

<h2>Early Computers</h2>
The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b>
such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the 
<u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept 
of a programmable computer</strong>.

<h2>Generations of Computers </h2>
The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has 
evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, 
while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal 
and affordable</em>.

Mathematics in Computing
A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>
Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.

<h2>Birth of the Internet </h2>
The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
<blockquote>
   "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
   Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
   an essential aspect." 
   â€“ <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
</blockquote>
<h2>Modern Era </h2>

Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and 
fiber connections. Computers now fit in our 
<small>pockets as smartphones</small>.
