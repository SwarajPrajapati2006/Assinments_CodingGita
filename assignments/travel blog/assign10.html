        <p>What is HTML?
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure the
            content of a webpage.

            Think of it as the skeleton or the blueprint of a website. While other languages like CSS add styling (the
            clothes) and JavaScript adds functionality (the actions), HTML provides the fundamental structure.

            How does it work?
            HTML works by using a system of predefined markers to "mark up" or annotate text. These markers, called
            elements, tell the web browser how to display the content.

            <p>Featured articles in Wikipedia

                This star symbolizes the featured content on Wikipedia.
                Featured articles are considered to be some of the best articles Wikipedia has to offer, as determined
                by Wikipedia's editors. They are used by editors as examples for writing other articles. Before being
                listed here, articles are reviewed as featured article candidates for accuracy, neutrality,
                completeness, and style according to our featured article criteria. Many featured articles were
                previously good articles (which are reviewed with a less restrictive set of criteria). Featured articles
                comprise 6,795 out of a total of 7,057,007 articles on the English Wikipedia (about 0.1% or one out of
                every 1,030 articles). Articles that no longer meet the criteria can be proposed for improvement or
                removal at featured article review.</p>
