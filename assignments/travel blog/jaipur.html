🏰 Jaipur – The Pink City of India

Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, is one of the most vibrant and culturally rich cities in India. Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, it is famous for its royal heritage, grand forts, colorful markets, and traditional Rajasthani hospitality.

✨ Why It’s Called the Pink City

In 1876, the entire city was painted pink to welcome the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). Since then, pink has remained the symbolic color of Jaipur, giving it the title Pink City.</p>
