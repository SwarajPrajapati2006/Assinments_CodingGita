        <h3> Floods in Assam</h3>
        <br>Assam Grapples With Renewed Flooding as Monsoon Intensifies
        Guwahati, Assam - September 16, 2025 – Heavy monsoon rains over the past several days have once again plunged
        Assam into a state of high alert, with multiple districts experiencing a fresh wave of flooding. The mighty
        Brahmaputra and its tributaries are flowing above the danger mark in several areas, inundating vast tracts of
        land, affecting thousands of people, and threatening wildlife in the region's famed national parks.

        According to the latest reports from the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), districts such as
        Golaghat and Biswanath are among the worst affected. In Golaghat, the Dhansiri river has submerged extensive
        areas, forcing residents of riverine communities to seek shelter in safer locations. The district administration
        has issued a flood alert for at least six revenue circles and has activated an emergency helpline for rescue and
        relief operations. Similarly, in Biswanath, a crucial bridge has reportedly collapsed, affecting hundreds of
        families.



        This recent spell of floods underscores the perennial challenge facing the state, which experiences devastating
        deluges annually during the monsoon season, typically from June to September.

        Why Assam is a Flood-Prone Region
        The state's susceptibility to flooding is a complex issue stemming from a combination of geographical, climatic,
        and anthropogenic factors.

        Geographical Layout: Assam is a valley state with the massive Brahmaputra River running through its heart. The
        river, along with its extensive network of over 120 tributaries, originates in the high-rainfall regions of the
        Himalayas. As these rivers descend to the low-lying plains of Assam, they deposit enormous amounts of sediment,
        raising the riverbeds and reducing their water-carrying capacity.


        Heavy Monsoon Rains: The region receives some of the highest rainfall in the country during the monsoon. This
        year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast active to vigorous monsoon conditions in the
        Northeast for early September, contributing to the current situation.


        Climate Change: Rising global temperatures are believed to be intensifying rainfall patterns, leading to more
        frequent and severe flooding events. The increased melting of Himalayan glaciers also contributes to higher
        river flows.


        Human Factors: Deforestation in the catchment areas leads to increased soil erosion and sediment load in the
        rivers. Furthermore, encroachment on floodplains and wetlands, which act as natural sponges, has severely
        hampered the region's natural drainage systems.


        The Widespread Impact of the Floods
        The consequences of these annual floods are multifaceted and devastating, affecting every aspect of life in the
        state.

        Humanitarian Crisis
        Thousands of people are often displaced, forced to take shelter in temporary relief camps. The floods lead to a
        loss of homes, livelihoods, and tragically, lives. Access to clean drinking water and food becomes a critical
        challenge, and the risk of water-borne diseases increases significantly.


        Economic Toll
        Agriculture, the backbone of Assam's economy, suffers immensely as floodwaters submerge and destroy standing
        crops. Critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and embankments, is severely damaged, disrupting
        communication and transportation networks.

        Ecological Damage: A Threat to Kaziranga
        The floods pose a grave threat to the unique biodiversity of Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site and home to the world's largest population of one-horned rhinoceroses. While the annual flooding is a
        natural process that helps rejuvenate the park's ecosystem by replenishing its wetlands and grasslands, severe
        floods can be deadly. Animals are forced to flee to higher ground, often having to cross a busy national
        highway, which leads to vehicle collisions. Many animals, especially the young and old, drown in the deluge.

        Response and Mitigation Efforts
        Both immediate and long-term measures are being undertaken by state and central authorities to manage the
        crisis.

        Immediate Response: The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) are
        deployed for rescue and evacuation operations. The government sets up relief camps and distribution centers to
        provide essential supplies like food, water, and medicine to the affected population. The Central Government has
        recently approved financial assistance from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for Assam to manage the
        impact of the monsoon.


        Long-Term Solutions: Efforts are ongoing to find more durable solutions. These include strengthening and
        building new embankments, regular dredging of rivers to increase their water-holding capacity, and the
        restoration of wetlands and forests. The ASDMA is also working on improving its Flood Early Warning System
        (FLEWS) to provide more specific and timely alerts to vulnerable communities, allowing for better preparedness.

        <h3>New metro lines</h3>
        <br>
        1. North-South Corridor Extension (Yellow Line)
        This is a major extension of the existing Red Line, connecting Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad to Mahatma Mandir in
        Gandhinagar.

        Operational Stretch: A significant 20.8 km portion of this line, from Motera to Sector-1 and further to
        Sachivalaya (Secretariat) in Gandhinagar, is now open to the public.

        Key Stations Now Open: This stretch includes important stops like GNLU, Raysan, Randesan, Dholakuva Circle,
        Infocity, and Sector-1.

        Under Construction: The final segment from Sachivalaya to Mahatma Mandir is still being worked on, with
        completion expected by the end of 2025.

        2. Branch Line to GIFT City (Violet Line)
        A crucial new branch line has been built to connect the region to the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City
        (GIFT City).

        Route: This line splits from the main North-South corridor at Gujarat National Law University (GNLU) station.

        Status: This 5.4 km link, with stations at Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) and GIFT City, is now
        operational. This provides a vital public transport link for the growing financial hub.

        Future Plans


        Looking ahead, the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) has even more ambitious plans:

        Airport Connectivity: A detailed project report (DPR) has been submitted for a metro line to connect the main
        network to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.

        Circular Metro: A "Circular Metro" line paralleling Ahmedabad's Ring Road is in the planning stages. This aims
        to connect various parts of the city and will include a stop near Sanathal to provide access to the future
        Dholera International Airport.


        Expansion to Other Cities: The government is also actively planning metro rail systems for other major Gujarat
        cities, including Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot. The Surat Metro is already well under construction.
